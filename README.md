# Eagles-vs-Hawks
This is my very first Computer Vision project that I made using fast.ai and PyTorch.
I created a balanced dataset consisting of a total of 180 images of eagles and hawks using DuckDuckGo's API and then fine-tuned a pre-trained ResNet18 architecture for the dataset.
As you can see below, the model achieved an accuracy of 97.7%
